2D Softbody Cloth simulation made by Matthew Jackson

This application is a modified version of my 2D physics simulation which I made as a side project.



- use arrow keys to change gravity (or space to set no gravity)

- press space to toggle kinematic status of the cloth's corners or press Q,W,A or S to set the corners individually

- To open the simulation open Project2D.exe
